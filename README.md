# Configuration IDE

How to proceed

Here is the procedure for installing and updating the programs that we will use in the web project.

In this project we will always use the latest updates of the installed applications.

## PhpStorm

**Update :**

_If you do not have PhpStorm please download it [here](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).

Open PhpStorm, go to the &quot;File/Settings&quot; tab, search for &quot;Updates&quot; in the search bar and click on &quot;Check for Updates&quot;.

**Installation of the interpreter and the PHP version :**

I remind that in each project it is necessary to have its PHP interpreter activated.

Go again to &quot;File/Settings&quot; but this time if you are on the PHP tab. Set your PHP language level to 8.0 and activate your CLI interpreter.

If you are missing the interpreter download it here and install it with the help of the documentation provided.

**Setting up of Xdebug :**

To simply have the xdebug go to &quot; Run/ Run &quot; then select &quot; formulaire.php &quot;.

## Git

**Installation :**

If git is not installed on your machine you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/), select your operating system and take the latest 64 bit version.

Just click on Next throughout the installation.

At the time of your first commands, git will ask you for an identification, just execute to the letter what it asks you and identify yourself with your browser.

**Update :**

* On Windows: _git update-git-for-windows

* On Linux: _sudo apt-get update_ puis _sudo apt-get install git

* On Mac: _brew update_ puis _brew upgrade git

## Doxygen

**Installation :**

Go to this link, scroll down until you find the &quot;Source and Binaries&quot; section. Download the installer for the OS of your choice..

Just click on Next throughout the installation.

Slack

**Installation :**

Just download the application available [here](https://slack.com/intl/fr-ch/). If you have a linux or mac, just add a "/linux or /mac to the url.

You will still need to create an account.

## Client SSH

**Installation Windows :**

First of all, press the Windows key + R, in the window copy-paste this command: ms-settings:optionalfeatures. A window will then open, you will have to look for SSH and install it.

To start the service, you have to go to the service application and look for OpenSSH SSH Server, then set the service to manual start (or automatic).
